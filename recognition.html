                            together. Because of his ‘student for life’ mindset, he’s also eager to learn new
                            technologies, and that’s how our team became the forerunner in using his Python & automation

                        <p class="card-text"> "As fierce as a Tiger" is what comes to mind when I think about Nikhil.
                            I had the pleasure to be Nikhil's manager over more than a year at Accenture.
                            I was particularly impressed by Nikhil's ability to resolve the toughest data analytics
                            problems in record time and effortlessly. Plus the amazing ability to communicate the
                            technical information to our non-technical Clients.
                            These skills often requires years and years to develop, however it seems like a natural
                            talent for him.
                            Nikhil would be a true asset for any position requiring Data Warehousing, Data Analytics and
                            Data Engineering and comes with my heartfelt recommendation.</p>
